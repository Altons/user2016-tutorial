# Extracting data from the web APIs and beyond

No matter what your domain of interest or expertise, the internet is a treasure trove of useful data that comes in many shapes, forms, and sizes, from beautifully documented fast APIs to data that need to be scraped from deep inside 1990s html pages. In this 3 hour tutorial you will learn how to programmatically read in various ways from experts in the field (Founders of the rOpenSci project and the training lead of RStudio). By the end of the tutorial you will have a basic idea of how to wrap a R package around a standard API, extract common non-standard data formats, and scrape data into tidy data frames from web pages.

All material for the tutorial will be posted at: `http://ropensci.github.io/user2016-tutorial/` (including instructions on packages that you'll need to install ahead of time).
